The recorded enumerations will have events for “phase begin green”, “phase gap out”, “phase max out”, “phase begin yellow clearance”, “phase end yellow clearance”, “pedestrian begin walk”, “pedestrian begin clearance”, “detector off”, “detector on”, etc.  For each event, a time-stamp is given and the event is stored temporarily in the location controller.  Over 125 various enumerations are currently in use.  Then, using an FTP connection from a remote server to the traffic location controller, packets of the hi resolution data logger enumerations (with its 1/10th second resolution time-stamp) are retrieved and stored on a web server at the UDOT Traffic Operations Center about every 10 to 15 minutes (unless the “upload current data” checkbox is enabled, where an FTP connection will be immediately made and the data will be displayed in real-time).  Software was written in-house by UDOT that allows us to graph and display the various data-logger enumerations and to show the results on the UDOT Automated Traffic Location Performance Measures website.',

The QIT evaluated existing operations, national best practices, and NCHRP recommendations to better improve UDOT’s location maintenance and operations practices.  One of the recommendations from the QIT was to “implement real-time monitoring of system health and quality of operations”.  The real-time Automated Location Performance Measures allow us to greatly improve the quality of location operations and to also know when equipment such as pedestrian detection or vehicle detection is not working properly.  We are simply able to do more with less and to manage traffic more effectively 24/7.  In addition, we are able to optimize intersections and corridors when they need to be re-optimized, instead of on a set schedule.',

        '<b>How do you use the various Location Performance Measures and what do they do?</b> ',
      body: "There are many uses and benefits of the various measures.  Some of the key uses are:<br/><br/><u>Purdue Coordination Diagrams (PCD’s)</u> – Used to visualize the temporal relationship between the coordinated phase indications and vehicle arrivals on a cycle-by-cycle basis.  The PCD’s show the progression quality along the corridor and answer questions, such as “What percent of vehicles are arriving during the green?” or “What is the platoon ratio during various coordination patterns?” The PCD’s are instrumental in optimizing offsets, identifying oversaturated or under saturated splits for the coordinated phases, the effects of early return of green and coordinated phase actuations, impacts of queuing, adjacent location synchronization, etc.<br/> <br/>In reading the PCD’s, between the green and yellow lines, the phase is green; between the yellow and red lines, the phase is yellow; and underneath the green line, the phase is red.  The long vertical red lines during the late night hours is showing the main street sitting in green as the side streets and left turns are being skipped.  The short vertical red lines show skipping of the side street / left turns or a late start of green for the side street or left turn.  AoG is the percent of vehicles arriving during the green phase.  GT is the percent of green split time for the phase and PR is the Platoon Ratio (Equation 15-4 from the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual).<br/><br/><u>Approach Volumes</u> – Counts the approach vehicle volumes as shown arriving upstream of the intersection about 350 ft – 400 ft.  The detection zones are in advance of the turning lanes, so the approach volumes don’t know if the vehicles are going straight through, turning left or right.  The accuracy of the approach volumes tends to undercount under heavy traffic and under multi-lane facilities.  Approach volumes are used in traffic models, as well as identifying directional splits in traffic. In addition, the measure is also used in evaluating the least disruptive time to allow lanes to be taken for maintenance and construction activities.<br/><br/><u/>Approach Speeds</u> – The speeds are obtained from the Wavetronix radar Advance Smartsensor.  As vehicles cross the 10-foot wide detector in advance of the intersection (350 ft – 400 ft upstream of the stop bar), the speed is captured, recorded, and time-stamped.  In graphing the results, a time filter is used that starts 15 seconds (user defined) after the initial green to the start of the yellow.  The time filter allows for free-flow speed conditions to be displayed that are independent of the traffic location timings.  The approach speed measure is beneficial in knowing the approach speeds to use for modeling purposes – both for normal time-of-day coordination plans and for adverse weather or special event plans.  They are also beneficial in knowing when speed conditions degrade enough to warrant a change in time-of-day coordination plans to adverse weather or special event plans.  In addition, the speed data is used to set yellow and all-red intervals for location timing, as well as for various speed studies.<br/><br/><u>Purdue Phase Termination Charts</u> – Shows how each phase terminates when it changes from green to red.  The measure will show if the termination occurred by a gapout, a maxout / forceoff, or skip.  A gapout means that not all of the programmed time was used.  A maxout occurs during fully actuated (free) operations, while forceoff’s occur during coordination.  Both a maxout and forceoff shows that all the programmed time was used. A skip means that the phase was not active and did not turn on.  In addition, the termination can be evaluated by consecutive occurrences in a approach.  For example, you can evaluate if three (range is between 1 and 5) gapouts or skips occurred in a approach.  This feature is helpful in areas where traffic volume fluctuations are high.  Also shown are the pedestrian activations for each phase.  What this measure does not show is the amount of gapout time remaining if a gapout occurred.  The Split Monitor measure is used to answer that question.<br/><br/>This measure is used to identify movements where split time may need to be taken from some phases and given to other phases.  Also, this measure is very useful in identifying problems with vehicle and pedestrian detection.  For example, if the phase is showing constant maxouts all night long, it is assumed that there is a detection problem.<br/><br/><u>Split Monitor</u> – This measure shows the amount of split time (green, yellow and all-red) used by the various phases at the intersection.  Greens show gapouts, reds show maxouts, blues show forceoffs and yellows show pedestrian activations.  This measure is useful to know the amount of split time each phase uses.Turning Movement Volume Counts – this measure shows the lane-by-lane vehicles per hour (vph) and total volume for each movement.  Three graphs are available for each approach (left, thru, right).  Also shown for each movement are the total volume, peak hour, peak hour factor and lane utilization factor.  The lane-by-lane volume counts are used for traffic models and traffic studies.<br/><br/><u>Approach Delay</u> – This measure shows a simplified approach delay by displaying the time between detector activations during the red phase and when the phase turns green for the coordinated movements.  This measure does not account for start-up delay, deceleration, or queue length that exceeds the detection zone.  This measure is beneficial in evaluating over time the delay per vehicle and delay per hour values for each coordinated approach.<br/><br/><u>Arrivals on Red</u> – This measure shows the percent of vehicles arriving on red (inverse of % vehicles arriving on green) and the percent red time for each coordination pattern.  The Y axis is graphing the volume (vph) and the secondary Y axis graphs the percent vehicles arriving on red.  This measure is useful in identifying areas where the progression quality is poor.<br/><br/><u>Yellow and Red Actuations</u> – This measure plots vehicle arrivals during the yellow and red portions of an intersection's movements where the speed of the vehicle is interpreted to be too fast to stop before entering the intersection. It provides users with a visual indication of occurrences, violations, and several related statistics. The purpose of this chart is to identify engineering countermeasures to deal with red light running.<br/><br/><u>Purdue Split Failure</u> – This measure calculates the percent of time that stop bar detectors are occupied during the green phase and then during the first five seconds of red. This measure is a good indication that at least one vehicle did not clear during the green.",

If your agency decided to make the Automated Location Performance Measures available to the public, it might be best to have a web server separate from the database server.Much of the heavy processing for the charts is done by web services, and it is possible to host these services on a dedicated computer.\r\n                        While each agency should consult with their IT department for specific guidelines on how to best deliver a secure, stable and responsive solution, we can estimate that most mid-range to high-end servers will be able to handle the task of hosting and creating measures for most agencies.<ul>\r\n                        <li>Windows Server 2008 or newer installed</li>\r\n                        <li>.NET 4.5.2 Framework installed</li>\r\n                        <li>IIS 7 or better installed, along with ASP.NET 4.0 or later</li>\r\n                        <li>SQL Server Express, SQL Server 2008 R2, or newer installed</li>\r\n                        <li>Firewall exceptions for connections to the controllers</li>\r\n                        <li>If Watchdog features are desired, installation requires access to an SMTP (email) server.
