Specification Pattern
Specification Design Pattern is created to ensure that the logical rules in an object are received from the outside. The rules of business are in a chain of successive chains, which may also reveal a more complex business rule.
I want to continue with a code example to understand the pattern. In repository Specification Pattern implemented by interface definition ;
public interface ISpecification<T>
    {
        Expression<Func<T, bool>> Criteria { get; }
        List<Expression<Func<T, object>>> Includes { get; }
        List<string> IncludeStrings { get; }
        Expression<Func<T, object>> OrderBy { get; }
        Expression<Func<T, object>> OrderByDescending { get; }
        int Take { get; }
        int Skip { get; }
        bool isPagingEnabled { get; }
    }
These definition and below implementation located in Core Layer. Because these classes not included Entity Framework Core related dependencies.
public abstract class BaseSpecification<T> : ISpecification<T>
    {
        protected BaseSpecification(Expression<Func<T, bool>> criteria)
        {
            Criteria = criteria;
        }
        public Expression<Func<T, bool>> Criteria { get; }
        public List<Expression<Func<T, object>>> Includes { get; } = new List<Expression<Func<T, object>>>();
        public List<string> IncludeStrings { get; } = new List<string>();
        public Expression<Func<T, object>> OrderBy { get; private set; }
        public Expression<Func<T, object>> OrderByDescending { get; private set; }
        public int Take { get; private set; }
        public int Skip { get; private set; }
        public bool isPagingEnabled { get; private set; } = false;
        protected virtual void AddInclude(Expression<Func<T, object>> includeExpression)
        {
            Includes.Add(includeExpression);
        }
        protected virtual void AddInclude(string includeString)
        {
            IncludeStrings.Add(includeString);
        }
        protected virtual void ApplyPaging(int skip, int take)
        {
            Skip = skip;
            Take = take;
            isPagingEnabled = true;
        }
        protected virtual void ApplyOrderBy(Expression<Func<T, object>> orderByExpression)
        {
            OrderBy = orderByExpression;
        }
        protected virtual void ApplyOrderByDescending(Expression<Func<T, object>> orderByDescendingExpression)
        {
            OrderByDescending = orderByDescendingExpression;
        }
    }
