### What's Changed

In ATSPM 5.1, we have fixed various bugs affecting functionality and security, while also adding the Transit Signal Priority report.

  - Average Split (sec)
  - Force Offs / Max Outs (%)
  - Gap Outs (%)
  - Skips (%)
  - Result Notes
  - Skips > 70% TSP Max
  - Force Offs < 40% TSP Max
  - Force Offs < 60% TSP Max
  - Force Offs < 80% TSP Max
