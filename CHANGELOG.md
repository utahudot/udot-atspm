### What's Changed

In ATSPM 5.1, we have fixed various bugs affecting functionality and security, while also adding the Transit Signal Priority report.

### Added

#### Reports Dropdown

In the left drawer of the website, we have added a new tab called "Reports." The new "Transit Signal Priority" report and "Left Turn Gap" report can be found in this drop down.

  - Min Time
  - 85th Percentile Split (sec)
  - 50th Percentile Split (sec)
  - Average Split (sec)
  - Force Offs / Max Outs (%)
  - Gap Outs (%)
  - Skips (%)
  - Result Notes
  - Skips > 70% TSP Max
  - Force Offs < 40% TSP Max
  - Force Offs < 60% TSP Max
  - Force Offs < 80% TSP Max
